# [Project 1 : HR Data Analysis](https://github.com/Hines98/HR-Analysis_PBI_project)
The objective of this project is to create a dashboard that addresses the challenges faced by HR professionals and provides an effective way to answer their daily questions. The dashboard will offer real-time insights into active employees, new hires, separations, and other key metrics to support strategic decision-making. This tool aims to enable HR to:
1. Track employee trends: Hiring, separations, and active employees
2. Analyze demographic and performance data: Distribution of employees by gender, age, and tenure.
